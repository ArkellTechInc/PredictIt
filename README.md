# Predict It App - Android, iOS
## Purpose
- Allow sports fans a fast, convenient option for predicting the outcome of a match. This app will predict the winner based on data and machine learning with a 50% or higher success rate.

## Functionality
- Browse Upcoming Games (1 week)
- Search Upcoming Games (1 week)
- Spend in-game currency to have the app predict a winner.
- If wrong, refund in game currency (after game)
- Display relative data to back up prediction
- Disclaimer that the predictions are purely speculation and the app in no way guarantees accuracy. What the user decides to do with the information is up to them, and the Predict It App will not be liable for any actions or consequences of using said information.

## Questions and Problems
- Which game/s do we want to do?
- Where are we getting the data?
- Are we storing some or all of it ourselves, or via a public API
- What data do we want to use besides player statistics? e.g. weather, social media etc.
- Are we writing our own, private API, or is it going to be public (what are the security risks of each, and do the play stores allow it)
- What stack should we use?
- How much should we charge for predictions? for in-game currency?
- How do we avoid lawsuits?
- Does the nature of the app prevent it from scaling/being a viable business. (the more it is shared, the less people profit from the knowledge)

## Roles
